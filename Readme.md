# Unsplash Asset Source

Note: This package is currently **just a proof of concept** on how to implement an external image provider as Neos asset source.

## How to try it out

* Read the [Unsplash API guidelines](https://medium.com/unsplash/unsplash-api-guidelines-28e0216e6daa) carefully!
* Clone the package (as its not ready to be registered on packagist) to your Package/Application folder.
* Require `unsplash/unsplash` in your root composer.json
* Register on [https://unsplash.com/developers](https://unsplash.com/developers) and get your API key.
* Configure the API key in the settings
